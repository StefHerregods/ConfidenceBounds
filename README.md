&emsp;&emsp;Perceptual decision-making and decision confidence in humans are two widely researched phenomena in psychological research. The decision-making process in two-alternative forced choice perceptual decisions is often thought to be well represented through a drift diffusion model. However, it is unclear how decision confidence is formed in relation to this model.    
&emsp;&emsp;In this project, we investigate an extension of the drift diffusion model in which decision confidence is seen as a secondary decision, and modeled by the addition of confidence bounds that can be reached after making a decision. To examine this model, participants completed multiple blocks of random dot motion trials.
