# Hypothesis (a)
# Faster decision reaction times and lower accuracy when participants are 
# asked to respond quickly (vs accurately), 
# without an effect on confidence reaction times and confidence ratings.


# (b) Faster confidence reaction times and less accurate confidence ratings 
# (i.e., confidence ratings that are less precise in the prediction of accuracy)
# when participants are asked to give quick confidence ratings 
# (vs think carefully about their ratings), 
# with no effect on decision accuracy and decision reaction times.


# (c) Faster and more accurate decisions, and faster and more accurate 
# confidence ratings in easier trials than in more difficult trials.
