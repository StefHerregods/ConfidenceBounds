# ConfidenceBounds

Internship project at [DesenderLab](https://desenderlab.com/) (KU Leuven)  
  
## Description
  
Perceptual decision-making and decision confidence in humans are two widely researched phenomena in psychological research. The decision-making process in two-alternative forced choice perceptual decisions is often thought to be well represented through a drift diffusion model. However, it is unclear how decision confidence is formed in relation to this model. In this project, we investigate an extension of the drift diffusion model in which decision confidence is seen as a secondary decision, and modeled by the addition of confidence bounds that can be reached after making a decision. To examine this model, participants completed multiple blocks of random dot motion trials.
